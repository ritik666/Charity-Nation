					A charitable organization is an organization that supports a cause by fundraising or through donations and charity. The organisations arrange for all the distribution of any money to each cause.<br><br>
					Charity is the act of giving help to those in need of it. It is a humanitarian act. It involves giving money, goods or time and effort to those who need it. It is done without expecting something in return. Giving money or food to poor people is an example of charity. Poor, sick or injured people are generally considered the proper people to whom charity should be given. When such people are not supported, they often begin begging, which is directly asking for help from people they do not know.Others may rely on support from charitable organisations. These organisations collect money and goods and then give them to those in need.<br><br>

Most charities are concerned with providing basic needs, such as food, water, clothing, health care and shelter. The most common form of charity is donating money. The money is then used to buy these basic needs. However, there are many other actions that may be performed as charity, such as teaching orphans, donating blood, or money to help fund medical research.<br><br>

Charitable giving can be a responsibility in many religions. This kind of charity is called almsgiving or alms. In Islam, for example, it is called zakat. It is one of the five most important duties of being a Muslim.</p></div>

				    <h2><b>Sponsor a child and change a life!</b>​</h2>
 		               <p>When a child receives an education, their future is brighter and their dreams become a possibility. When a child goes to school, he will no longer need to work in a quarry or beg in the streets for food. An educated child will be able to find employment to secure a future for them and their family, a chance to earn a sustainable income, helping them to break the poverty cycle. Through becoming better educated, a child can be informed much earlier about their health and wellbeing thus, reducing the chances of child marriage, early pregnancies and HIV/AIDS contraction.</p><br>

 		              <h3> Our Mission & Vision</h3>

<p>At 22stars, we're on a mission to empower families in Uganda to rise above poverty through education, entrepreneurship and local leadership.</p><br>

 

<p>We believe that economic development and education, along with fostering a strong sense of community, are key to helping communities break free of poverty. Our projects use an integrated approach to community development - focusing on the development of economic, social, natural, human, and cultural capital.</p><br>

 

<p>Our programs and projects empower Ugandan people to preserve their culture, environment, and society.</p><br>

 

<p>Our long-term vision is to have our own education center where both children and their parents can learn and develop their entrepreneurship skills.</p><br>




<h3>What makes us different</h3>

<p>We are different from other organisations in that our projects aim to strengthen the community as a whole.</p><br>

 

<p>We work in the most impoverished areas of Kampala and Jinja, where the need for even the most basic essentials is high. Our project managers, who are members of the communities they service, communicate with their community directly to understand what their principal needs. Our intention is to collaborate with the community to ensure our projects can have an effective impact with enduring results. We hence do not focus on only a specifc cause or group, such as "girls" or "clean water", but on the community as a whole. As we believe that everything is interrelated and hence if you only focus on sending boys to school and leave girls out or vice versa and don't also look after their medical needs, their home situation and so on you can not reach the full potential.</p><br>

<h3>The meaning behind 22STARS</h3>

<h4>Stars are used as a symbol of the interconnectivity and unity of humankind.</h4>

 

<p>Each person on Earth has access to the vastness of the night sky, by simply looking up. For millennia, we have looked to the stars for guidance and navigation, for hope and protection. The number 22 has a long history of representing change for the better – for making even the most ambitious dreams a reality.</p>
